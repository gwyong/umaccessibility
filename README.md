# Accessibility Assessment Project

We aim to use computer vision technology to automatically detect accessibility problems throughout various cities and pinpoint their exact locations. By doing so, we hope to sharpen the focus of urban improvement projects and enhance accessibility for everyone.
We welcome any feedback! If you have any questions, suggestions, or ideas about the project, feel free to reach out. Your input is highly appreciated as we work to improve urban accessibility.
